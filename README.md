# A simple style checker for the non-subjective parts of the style guidelines as per the style guide at https://github.com/csnwc/Exercises-In-C/blob/main/exercisesInC.pdf

## Small note on terms of usage

This is a small personal project made to help people adhere to the style guidelines in the Exercises in C book. A star on this repo is appreciated and is free so therefore it is strongly advised.

## Usage

First clone the repo:

```bash
git clone
```

Then navigate to the directory:

```bashcd Exercises-In-C-style-checker

```

Then run the script with the file you want to check as an argument:

```bash python3 style_checker.py <file_to_check.c>

```

## Limitations

This script is a simple style checker and does not cover all the style guidelines. It is meant to check the basics so that you are not penalised for simple mistakes.
It is not perfect so please use it as a guide as opposed to Gospel truth.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repo and make a pull request with any improvements or additional checks.
